Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

* Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and rename the folder with "data".
* Put the folder "data" and the run_analysis.R script both in the current working directory.
* Use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio. 
* Two output files are generated in the current working directory:
  - merged_data.txt: cleaned and labelled data after Step 4.
  - average_data.txt: selected avarage data after step 5.
